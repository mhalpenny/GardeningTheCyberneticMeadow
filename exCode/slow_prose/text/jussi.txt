I. A SLoW PhoToGRAPhIC ChEMISTRy of AN ExTENDED WAR Let us start with a hypothesis that opens up the discussion about the contemporary in this text: The contemporary con.dition expands to a multitude of times that overlap and that cannot be resolved into one, simple designation such as ÒnewÓ or Òold.Ó That is also the reason why I want to address the contemporary as a multitemporal reality where slowness entangles with the technological microtemporalities; time-critical media that are of time, but more importantly, manipulate the time-axis, which (in)forms our horizon of perception, ethics, affects, and more. hence the contemporary becomes detached from human-only time and to a time of other sort of tempor(e).alities as they pertain to the current moment. This sort of an asynchronous ontology of time has been already discussed in contexts of the postdigital as one particular way to understand media culture that does not proceed in one unified rhythm of experience or development. Geoff Cox has particularly clearly demonstrated that Ò[t]he complexity of historical temporalityÓ is one that does not resolve itself to a historical periodization so much as to a cartography of the multiple levels, processes and conceptualisations of time that then produces also a map of issues: the contemporary as a Òmoment in which shared issues that hold a certain currency are negotiated and expanded.Ó We need to adjust to a complex sense of perception of time that constitutes the contemporary. I am interested in how the contemporary condition enables a focus on the tight link between environmental issues and technology, or more specifically: to address media technologies in the context of the Anthropocene and climate change. This shifts from the focus on technologies to the wider environmental and other rhythms that permeate our techno.logical culture. This essay is a short take on the technological contemporary, and how it is grounded in the slowness of earthÕs dynamics, visual operations, geopolitics, and colonial arrangements. I am interested in how the contemporary planetary situation is a complex ecology of space, governance, and time. The contemporary becomes this sort of a fluid horizon where the relevancy of contemporary art continues to be about the complexification of the time and place of the assumed now as a long temporal and geographic stretch. one can think of the contemporary as a way to open up the complex entanglement of the temporal determinations of what consti.tutes the now as a stretch between multiple time horizons, which however have an implication on place too: that is why the essay at times focuses on locations, spatial formations, and movements of materials across the planet. Thus, the contem.porary has an angle towards time: it is a marker of temporality and this essay has a particular focus of addressing a cartog.raphy of that temporality as part of technology. It works through key terms such as slow violence that forms a particular rhythm of the contemporary that does not open to immediate experience, yet forms one background of that on a very bodily level too. This brings an alternative set of temporal concepts into play than discussing accelerationism or futurity Ñ hence, . of course, accelerationism is not so and Armen Avanessian, eds., Accelerate: much about speed, despite some of the The Accelerationist Reader (falmouth/ connotations, but a more complex set Berlin: Urbanomic/Merve, ). I am, of arguments relating to the possibilities however, more interested in a set of concepts of reappropriation of technological that help us to understand the multiplicities possibilities, platforms and infrastructures of time at play in contemporary culture, for alternative ends. for discussion and not merely as a future-oriented perspective. different positions, see Robin Mackay I want to address the idea of temporal conglomerations and deep times of contemporary geopolitics as slowness or long term durations that unfold as not immediate for the human perception. I want to start by way of photographic art. fig. : A close up of her Taraf Ð No ManÕs Land by GŸven .Iúncirliogù.lu. Used with permission. As part of a selection of works from the rd and th ‚anakkale Biennial in Turkey, GŸven .IúncirliogùluÕs installation . piece her Taraf Ð No ManÕs Land from  is one of the many art and culture commentaries about the Gallipoli campaign, also known as Dardanelles Campaign, that took place on Turkish soil during the first World War. The events have been commemorated over the past times on many occasions and by many institutions from official governments to universities to cultural institutions. The war and its relation to modern Europe and global geopolitics has multiple narratives, and for historians of media and technology, it has been marked as a turning point of the twentieth century. The war was also a mobilization of new technologies including the wristwatch and different solutions for wireless communication on the front line; the media connections were important in military operations, but they also started to enter the private sphere of the domestic life. In addition, the chemical technologies presented a more efficient way of destruction from the air both as planes and as chemical warfare, which was employed on the European front effectively; such also formed the backbone of the pesticide-enhanced agriculture of the twentieth and twenty-first century. Many of the military operations and events took place on the outskirts of our current version of Europe, including Turkey and the ottoman Empire. A hundred years after the war, and a hundred years after the start of the naval assault by Britain and france, on  April , the digital photographs in the installation tell a partial historical story about what remains after the war and its devastation. The images do not, however, feature the usual iconography of human memory: of old photographs juxtaposed with other objects of memories; of faces as souvenirs of the old grainy image era transported in photography. It is a story not so much of faces but of landscapes of war and technology, of chemistry and destruction. The photographic installation is itself a sort of a mini-landscape that occupies one wall. The images commemorate the first World War as an event of technological warfare of massive ecological scales. But it also becomes clear that the commemoration works in alternative ways; it is less as a celebration of the ottoman victory than a subtle sort of a monument that entangles social history and natural history, and acts as a conglomeration of different temporal regimes. Even this distancing from the nationalist narrative is worthwhile noticing in the midst of the years of strong religiously tuned nationalist rhetoric and policy measures of current day Turkey. But the temporal politics of the images works differently. Enhanced by the atmosphere of silence surrounding the digital images placed on the walls of the Depo-gallery. piece is described as a commentary on the two times of Òhuman life and the time of nature,Ó as the accompanying text on the wall informs. A usual historical narrative builds the memory around the  year milestone from the events, but the piece reminds of the multiple ways of narrating and recording time Ñ not a passing of time, but a slow chemical sedimentation of time; it reminds how time is not merely a passing of events, but a milieu of multiple ways of accounting for it in the midst of human and non-human agents. It expresses a landscape of time, but not a landscape of the usual mastery through which we have been accustomed to think of nature in art history. It is a landscape, which we are still involved in. fig. : Installation view at Depo Gallery of her Taraf Ð No ManÕs Land by GŸven .Iúncirliogùlu. Used with permission.. The title No ManÕs Land refers to the contested zone between the trenches that during the long months until January  changed occupation many times. It brings to mind the various historical narratives of human misery that the existential non-space of the trench meant Ñ both in terms of anxiety of waiting, the deadly warfare and also the stink of diseased bodies. for material stories of the war, writers have addressed Òbunker archaeologyÓ as the architectural legacy of war that transforms into the concrete aesthetics of the Cold War that still lingers on in port and other towns bombed down during the latter of the two world wars, and replaced by Brutalist building blocks in many of their central quarters. But .Iúncirliogùlu. . Paul Virilio, Bunker Archaeology, trans. George Collins (New york: Princeton . Paul Virilio, Bunker Archaeology, trans.

The geopolitical aim of landing through ‚anakkale to reach Istanbul never succeeded according to the plans, but the geophysical legacy of such warfare in the age of advanced machinery left its concrete trace in the soil. .IúncirliogùluÕs meditation is not, however, only . about that particular piece of land, the landing site and its territories formed of trenches, blue waters giving way to the war ships that connected to the supply routes, distant ports in England and other places, and many other operations; it also includes a global perspective. he continues by way of a short biospheric meditation of technical war: ÒToday, it is possible to say that the global state of war that also encompasses the biosphere has been going on for a century.Ó ú.Incirliogù.lu continues referring to the annihilation of masses in the Middle East, Africa, Asia Ñ an extension of the continued war; on the other, the Òtotal destruction of human habitats, rivers, forests and the biological-mineral world is being processed on by the neo-liberal policies worldwide. In this context, todayÕs IstanbulÕs northern forests, quarries, African gold mines, vast territories of fracking in Canada and all other sites of destruction [....] resemble the scene of a Ôno manÕs landÕ.Ó The story told was not after all a commemoration of a war that ended but the war that never ended; the war that facilitated an entry of new sorts of technical forms of control, . her Taraf, exhibition notes, . her Taraf. ‚anakkale Biennial: Coordinates û. ..'"N-û'"E, Depo Gallery, february Ð March . regulation, production of chemicals and more Ñ an apt theme considering we are living in a sort of a continuous Cold War defined by territorial claims, energy wars, realpolitik of terrorism entangled with geopolitics, movements of biomass that expresses itself as the human suffering of forced refugee movements. Beginnings and endings become only temporary markers for narratives that are insufficient for the complexity of this time. The sort of a war we are addressing does not lend itself to easy stories of ideological oppositions but to complex networks, which entangle strategies and tactics with environmental realities and the finitude of the world of energy and materials. These sorts of wars are geopolitical in the fundamental sense, and do not involve just the two sides of troops in trenches. Indeed, it moves the focus from the human actors, soldiers, tragedies of personal, family and other scales to those of soil, the ground, the air Ñ an elemental tragedy that is the backdrop in which a drama of the Anthropocene might unfold. It is also a tragedy that comes out clearest in its slowness. Rob NixonÕs study on Òslow violenceÓ is here an excellent reference point for a theoretical elaboration as to the environmental impact of colonialism, global corporate operations as well the modern warfare that cannot be statistically summarized in terms of the official casualties but needs a different sort of a narrative and temporal framework to reveal its longer term impact. Slow violence refers both to the realities of chemical and structural violence in different colonial and post-colonial conflicts and also the narrative ways in which to make this slow violence visible and accountable. Nixon refers to the necessity to apprehend this sort of slow reality, Òwhether on a cellular or a transnational scaleÓ and . on the extended legacy of the .

Who gets to see, and from where? When and how does such empowered seeing become normative? And what perspectives Ñ not least those of the poor or women or the colonized Ñ do hegemonic sight conventions of visuality obscure? PrattÕs formulation of planetary consciousness remains invaluable because it allows us to connect forms of apprehension to forms of imperial violence. What sort of politics is this? It picks up on a different set of temporal coordinates than many of the other discussions at the moment that emphasize acceleration and speed. It is more likely to speak to the set of concerns that Sarah Sharma has activated by way of reference to harold Innis. Sharma writes that Òthe temporal is political regardless of speed and is present no matter what the dominant technologies of the day are.Ó Sharma underlines how this is Ònot a new condition resulting . Nixon, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor, . from speedup but an enduring political and economic reality with important cultural effects.Ó her suggestion of a power-chronography is then an attempt to make sense of the multiple speeds that define various techniques, actions, infrastructures, and not least, lived experiences of contemporary culture. There is also another level that complements lived tempo.ralities and is another sort of time, perhaps non-human. Provocatively, Thomas Pynchon once suggested, about the Second World War, that perhaps it was never ideological in the traditional sense: This War was never political at all, the politics was all theatre, all just to keep the people distracted [...] secretly, it was being dictated instead by the needs of technology [...]. The real crises were crises of allocation and priority, not among firms Ñ it was only staged to look that way Ñ but among the different Technologies, Plastics, Electronics, Aircraft, and their needs which are understood only by the ruling elite. Such a provocation leads also to discuss what do technologies, plastics, and more need Ñ and how they link to the mobilization and exploitation of organic, including the environmental forces, including the worlds devoid of humans but full of life, chemical events, biospheric and atmospheric processes. This is a question of a political world of a different sort than in PynchonÕs GravityÕs Rainbow as it takes its aim at the global geopolitical and corporate measures that impose a regime of distraction. PynchonÕs version comes closer to narratives in media studies too, but also needs to be complemented with a related focus on power-chronographies, time-axis manipulation and slow .

We can call this a slow (media) technological violence of war: it is the soil, nature, the chemical residue that stayed as an archive of violence, and the chemical pollution that keeps on dispossessing certain human groups as much as various species and the biosphere in this extended warfare. It relates to the extended environmental impact of the link between contemporary multitempor(e)alities and the media technological materials as part of supply routes and the processes of fabrication involving rare earths and other earth materials that need to be refined for their usefulness as part of production of electronic objects. This slow media violence of geophysical proportions is the main milieu in which this text moves and builds its argument. II. MATERIALS of MEDIA Relating to the above contextualization of slow violence, one has to admit that war is a rather obvious starting point in media and art theory. The references to Pynchon as well as the history of the military and war are abundant in accounts such as friedrich KittlerÕs media theoretical insight into history as well as for example VirilioÕs take on technical visuality. In KittlerÕs writings, it was most often bound together with an evaluation and even a clandestine appreciation of the role of the military-industrial complex. Indeed, if, for Martin heidegger, Òtechnology is entrenched in our historyÓ (in his lectures on Parmenides) we learned via Kittler that it is in the trenches in which technology becomes history. Media technologies embody a clandestine history of military investment, engineering and scientific contexts, which some have also expressed with the term Òmilitary.industrial-entertainment-academic complex.Ó KittlerÕs writing argued for the existence of a secret story of mobilization of technology, knowledge, materials and energy that brought Kittler to a proximity with PynchonÕs narrative constructs. The huts of Bletchley Park, rocket sites at PeenemŸnde, abandoned radar stations, bunkers, are ruins of historical significance and reminders of the original sites where media technologies take place: computers, rockets, advanced mathematics employed as part of the war effort, giving us later the civilian uses of different audio and visual hardware, wireless communications and signal frequency hopping, and so forth. What trickles down, is visible and hearable as media . Besides KittlerÕs various books and texts, see for example, Geoffrey Winthrop-young, . Besides KittlerÕs various books Critical Inquiry, vol. , no.

As one minor contribution, I am interested in how KittlerÕs thoughts on materiality can be expanded and made to discuss the wider context in which technical media operate. My proposal relates to some of the more environmental histories of media materiality and how they present an alternative, at times complementary and at times diverting, suggestion. But instead of thinking of Òthe environmentÓ as a contained thing, I want to approach it through dynamics and temporalities. One such key concept for rethinking time and media comes from Siegfried Zielinski who introduced early on the idea of Òpalaeontology of media,Ó or Òdeep time of the media,Ó with however a focus different from mine. ZielinskiÕs focus is not related to the ecological turn I am interested in but offers the interesting set of concepts that bend time to become radically expanded to earth durations. The alternative focus and temporal schemes remind us that dynamic materiality, a secret life of other temporalities, does not have to start with war. It can commence from an appreciation of ecological multiplicities that seem to borrow more from the vocabulary of fŽlix . friedrich Kittler, ÒRock Music: .

Meditations on war have gradually turned to meditations concerning the more generalized hostilities to which we refer by the term ÒAnthropocene.Ó hence a proposition for a geological investigation of media culture is actually meant to work in this particular manner of expansion of interest and the realization of how media studies can be more than just media analysis or focus on the triangle of interests in Òtext, audience, industry.Ó It can inspire to expand and renew domains of knowledge (including academic methodology and theory); and also, more specifically, it can refresh what we mean by media materiality and by media time. It is an extension of the normal focus on social histories and times of the human media Ñ whether of the McLuhan type characterization of media as extensions of manÑor the more nuanced type of focus on the uses of media as tools. This other manner of extensions relates to the question of where we start a media studies analysis. Can we think of mediation as something more than just the thing contained in media devices?

In short, media is composed of the geophysical minerals and energies necessary to run high tech computational processes that constitute this other sort of a planetary level. What Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin branded as the ÒNoosphereÓ is actually a geopolitical circuiting of the planet via its underbelly, the infrastructure also necessary for the perception of the existence of the planet from its underground to its heavens, from its mines to its satellites in the sky. This conceptual shift is visible in many fields in media studies of the past years, as well as in the contemporary art world, which has embraced both a focus on the non-human and also a more specific focus on geophysics. I will return later to these ways the contemporary technological arts engage with the slow media violence in the Anthropocene. In writings and research about media, the rather simultaneous emergence of so many important studies about infrastructure is one such example of the raised awareness of the entanglement of media technologies and their environmental impact. It relates to the articulated connections between the most local and the planetary Ñ of sites of infrastructure and realities of global signal traffic, as Lisa Parks and Nicole Starosielski have presented. Besides foregrounding Òprocesses of distribution,Ó it also relates to opening up a new materialist perspective to this distribution: Òthe resources, technologies, labor, and relations that are required to shape, energize, and sustain the distribution of audiovisual signal traffic on global, national, and local scales.Ó Such are different structurations of time which .

They also function on the level of signals that are microtemporal. however, what moves is not only the time-critical technological operations of signal traffic, but also the materials that make signal traffic possible; the material infrastructures themselves are also, managed across planetary supply chains. An awareness of the mineral constitution of media has gradually entered the vocabulary of media theory too as has a careful mapping of the multiple levels of materials and technocultural practices that contribute to a historically and thematically expanded understanding of the critical backbone of media culture. In terms of the mineral and metal realities, coltan is often discussed because of its importance as an ore that can be refined as tantalum, an essential part of technological culture of game consoles, mobile phones and more. The chemical proper.ties of the rare earths are however in some cases embedded in the dirty politics of the supply routes, having included use of child labor in mining as well as contextualized in the complex political contexts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In other locations, such as in Baotou in China rare earth production also leaves not merely a proverbial trace, but a whole toxic landscape from the tailings: acids, heavy metals, carcinogens, and radioactive materials. But also other sorts of minerals, metals, and rare earths too are part of media technological culture, some of it very mundane, some of it less so: large amounts of tin, cobalt, palladium, silver, gold, and copper go to media technologies; copper was crucial for the establishment of the earlier, nineteenth and twentieth century global network society of telecommunications; lithium is one crucial alkalite . on microtemporalities that bypass the human cognitive and sensorial capacities,.

The detailed view of what makes media media is itself however connected to a wider set of networks and political economic questions and scientific contexts which are the conditions of existence of what constitutes the contemporary as media cultural situation. It is the sort of effective administrative reality that these sorts of lists about minerals and materials constitute and express one node in various geopolitical strategies and tactical operations that then go to enabling the smooth functioning of supply lines. hence in this spatial distribution of materials the question of when becomes also important; when do materials transform into refined materials, embedded into devices, transported across, entering into homes, cars, and other situations of use as entertainment and when in their lifespan do they turn again into a bundle of unusable materials, scrap metals, and residual minerals? In addition to the recent awareness in media theory, it is also a cultural historical theme that characterizes the Cold War. The necessity in management of energy and non-fuel mineral resources was in many ways about the management of energy and mineral resources. In the s, especially from the US and allied perspective, this related to what was referred to as the Òshort- and long-term reliability and availability of foreign sources of oil and other energy and nonfuel mineral .

While scholars such as Sean Cubitt have been especially important in talking of the need for a refined look at hardware Ñ and the neo-colonial ecopolitics of resource extraction that systematically have a relation with lax regulation in indigenous lands Ñ we can continue that line of thought to talk of the geophysics of media technologies as the true geos of geopolitics and the multiscalar reality of this material-temporal situation. The massive change from primary reliance on just few key materials only over  years ago (wood, brick, iron, copper, gold, silver, and then in the twentieth century plastics) has been replaced by a meticulous production, refinement, and standardization of minuscule elements, not least, minerals, that are crucial for the microchipped technological society. It was already recognized in Lewis MumfordÕs account from the s that the new technological period will be one of new power sources, petroleum, transportability but also of rare metals and metallic
